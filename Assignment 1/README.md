## Analysis

In the graph, x-axis is for the number of input sizes, where y-axis is for the computational cost. The more computation cost increases, the higher it will take time to solve the problem.

The graph shows the lowest computation cost among those 5 is theta(logn), which is marked as blue. That means among those five theta(logn) will be the best solution. As the x value increases, the computation cost doesn't increase that much for theta(logn)
